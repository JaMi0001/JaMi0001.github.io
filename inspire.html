        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Peter Parker aka Spider-Man has been an inspirational hero throughout my life. He gained his powers through a radio active spider which he uses to save the people in New York. He does not abuse these powers and he sacrifices his personal life from indangering the people he cares about. He his my hero because out of all the heros, he experiences the most pain while remaining selfless.</p>
